# Interaction checklist

Derived from tobi/disktree's 36-test harness (crates/disktree-app/src/tests.rs)
plus our skin-system surface. Automated entries were exercised blind via
`wtype`/`hyprctl`/`grim` on Hyprland (scale-2, wayland) against
`/home/eddix` and `/home/eddix/Codes` scans; each marked ✅ when the
screenshot/state evidence confirmed the tobi-expected behaviour.

## Scan lifecycle

- ✅ launch scans PATH (default `$HOME`), progress panel with files/dirs/
  measured/unreadable stats
- ✅ esc while scanning cancels; "Scan again" restarts
- ✅ `r` rescans; `i` toggles hidden (rescan); `d` toggles apparent (rescan)
- ✅ du parity: allocated bytes match `du -s` (M1 test, bit-exact on home)

## Treemap

- ✅ squarified tiles fill viewport; labels on tiles ≥54×15px, ≤150, by area
- ✅ header bands on subdivided directories; closed tiles below min area
- ✅ Others tile merges children beyond 96 (`+N more`)
- ✅ `[`/`]` depth 1–6 stepper + keys; tiles appear/disappear per level
- ✅ `t` cycles Size → Files → Age (areas re-rank; Age recolours by mtime
  buckets, verified by pixel histogram: bright-blue ≤7 d bucket dominates)

## Navigation

- ✅ enter opens selected directory; enter on a file opens its parent;
  enter with nothing selected opens the largest entry
- ✅ `u`/⌫ ascends; crumb bar reflects path; selection follows
- ✅ hjkl/arrows move by tobi's same-depth scoring (gap + 2.5×offset),
  off-the-edge left/up selects the parent-of-root
- ✅ tab cycles siblings next-largest by metric
- ✅ breadcrumb segment click jumps (`go_to`), root segments render
- ✅ alt←→ history back/forward (host-bound actions); `<`/`>` buttons
  enabled exactly when stacks are non-empty; side mouse buttons navigate
- ✅ wheel zoom anchors at pointer; `-`/`=`/`0` zoom centred; `-` at floor
  with descend=false is a no-op (pixel-identical frame, like tobi)
- ✅ shift-wheel pans vertically, clamped ≥0
- ✅ click selects; re-click on selected dir enters; double-click enters
- ✅ esc cascade: applied filter → selection → ascend → (at root) nothing

## Find / filter

- ✅ `/` (and `s`) opens the three-key field; typing updates live match
  count via the tree capability (`cargo` → 42 matches · 2.9 MiB)
- ✅ backspace edits; enter applies — mosaic keeps only matches at true
  relative sizes, largest selected; esc clears back to the full view
- ✅ typing with 0 matches does not apply (needle mismatch case verified)

## Panels & help

- ✅ hover tooltip follows cursor with edge flip; name + size + kind + age
- ✅ sidebar Selection: name/path/share/Files/Last write/Kind + Open/Reveal
- ✅ sidebar Worth a look: real findings (node modules, stale python
  packages, build artifacts), click selects
- ✅ sidebar Disk: free/used bar from statvfs
- ✅ `p` toggles the sidebar (pixel-diff verified)
- ✅ `?` overlay with full key list; esc/`?`/q closes; keys ignored while
  open (except those three)
- ✅ `o` reveals selection/hover/current dir via xdg-open parent
- ✅ `q` quits (close_window)

## Skins & themes

- ✅ `--export-skin NAME` writes app.toml, main.rhai, core.rhai,
  components/widgets.rhai, theme.rhai, themes/flexoki_light.rhai to
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/disktree-rhai/skins/NAME/`
- ✅ editing the export and running `--skin NAME` loads the edited copy
  (verified: header text change visible)
- ✅ `--dev`/`--skin-dev` hot-reload edits within ≤3 s; a broken edit
  surfaces the compile error without stranding the view
- ✅ `--skin ./skins/minimal` runs the second skin: slice-and-dice tiling,
  grayscale depth palette, no sidebar/controls — keys unchanged
- ✅ `--theme light` switches the Disktree family to Flexoki Light
  (paper #FFFCF0 surface, Flexoki blue accent, pale tile tints);
  default resolution: `--theme` > Omarchy `theme/colors.toml` mode > dark

## Known deviations (v1)

- crumb sibling menu (tobi's click-a-crumb dropdown) — v1.2 candidate
- labels dim-while-typing in find — cosmetic, not ported
- shift+tab reverse cycle — node key handlers carry no modifiers (G7/G8)
- growth animation on enter/ascend — v1.5 by design
